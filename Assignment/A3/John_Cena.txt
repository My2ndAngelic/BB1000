    'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
    What's Cena? It is nor hand, nor foot,
    Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
    Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
    What's in a name? That which we call a rose
    By any other word would smell as sweet;
    So John would, were he not John call'd,
    Retain that dear perfection which he owes
    Without that title. John, doff thy name,
    And for that name which is no part of thee
    Take all myself.
